### Motivation

I rarely need to create a console app, but it is a requirement to know how to properly create one to be consumed by clients.  In my case, these are usually Developers, Build Engineers, QA Engineers, and Operations.  After a few of these, I got tired to writing a help section, and trying to yet again pick the right open source parsers.  When finally looking at the the work that went into the app, most of it wasn't for the reason that I needed to build the app.  A console app should be something before you actually put in your reason for wanting one, i.e. your code to transform a json file into xml is harldy anything when compared to the help section.
